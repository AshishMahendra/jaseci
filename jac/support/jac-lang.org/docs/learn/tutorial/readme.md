# Introduction
In this tutorial, you are going to learn how to build a state-of-the-art conversational AI system with Jac Cloud and the Jac programming language and other popular open source python libraries. You will learn the basics of jaclang, how to use large language models, and everything in between, in order to create an end-to-end fully-functional conversational AI system. This tutorial requires Python 3.12 or higher. 

### Open Source Libraries and Tools (all pypi packages)
- **jaclang**:  
  A python superset language that introduces new coding abstractions for modern software and AI development

- **jac-cloud**:  
  A runtime stack plugin to Jac that automates just about everything needed for cloud server execution and deployment.

- **langchain_community**:  
  A collection of community-contributed tools, extensions, and utilities for the LangChain ecosystem. These contributions aim to extend LangChainâ€™s capabilities in building applications around large language models.

- **chromadb**:  
  ChromaDB is a vector database designed for storing embeddings and efficiently retrieving them. It is commonly used for machine learning and natural language processing applications to handle large volumes of high-dimensional data.

- **langchain**:  
  LangChain is a powerful framework designed to streamline the development of applications using large language models (LLMs). It provides a unified interface to connect with various LLMs and integrates with external data sources, making it ideal for building chatbots, question-answering systems, and other NLP tasks.

- **pypdf**:  
  PyPDF is a pure Python library for working with PDF files. It enables reading, modifying, and merging PDF files, supporting a wide range of operations like extracting text, splitting/merging documents, and manipulating metadata.


### Project Steps
